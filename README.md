# Project: Analyzing Airbnb Supply Patterns in European Cities
In this project, I explore Airbnb supply patterns across some of the most popuplar Euporean cities using exploratory data analysis and offer recommendations for deeper exploration.

The dataset and additional details can be accessed on the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities/data

## Outline
